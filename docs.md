# BSL Documentation

This is the documentation for the Bash Scripting Library (BSL)

Download BSL from https://github.com/MichaelAnckaert/bash-scripting-library

In lieu of formal documentation, check out the demos in the `demo` folder and read the source in the `lib` folder. The code is fairly straightforward and easy to read.
