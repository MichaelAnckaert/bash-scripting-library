# BSL Documentation

This is the documentation for the Bash Scripting Library (BSL)

Download BSL from https://github.com/MichaelAnckaert/bash-scripting-library

In lieu of formal documentation, check out the code in the `demos` folder, especially the file [demos/demo.sh](demos/demo.sh) as it contains a demonstration of all BSL features.

Also consider reading the source in the `lib` folder. The code is fairly straightforward and easy to read.
